# Dogs R Us

#### Come get a smooch from a pooch

To get started with Dogs R Us you will need to clone or download this repository.

### Prepare to Build

Navigate to the downloaded directory and install the dependencies by typing:
`yarn` or `npm install`

You can click here to install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) if you do not have them installed already.

### Build Instructions

You can now build a local copy and view it with the command:
`yarn start` or `npm start`

This will build a production version of Dogs R Us and open your browser for your viewing pleasure.

### Development Instructions

If you're interested in jumping in and helping make Dogs R Us the best it can be, you can run the `yarn dev` command
to start a development environment. This dev environment has HMR (hot module reloading) enabled and all you have to do is code away!
