# Dogs R Us

#### Come get a smooch from a pooch

## Guidance from the design team

"These images should be displayed on the page as a set of thumbnails; clicking on a thumbnail should display a full-sized image to the user."

"Full-size photos should be able to be closed, and the user should be returned to the thumbnail gallery."

## Requirements from the adoption team

"Starting next month, we'll be partnering with a shelter that has 2000 pets available for adoption. We need this page to be able to handle that many listings."

"Most people find out about us from internet searches. We need this page to appear towards the top of search results."
